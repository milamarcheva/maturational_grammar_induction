these we put into here
these are wing s and we 're put ing them into the clip
this is the wing

we 're put ing this clip onto the stick so it will go like an airplane
it 's not easy
no it 's not so easy
oh i see it did
now you turn the propeller many time s
okay let 's try it
you try it
now hold it up in the air and let go
it 's a sky dart

a sky dart
paul adam 's talk ing to you
do it more until it 's tight
no it does n't have wheel s

thank you
i guess when it hit s the floor it hit s so hard that it fall s off
i heard it
that 's the place to attach the dart to the propeller
it thought your arm was a tree
why did it think that
you did n't hold it up high enough
first you wind it many time s
then you hold it here and here and let go
paul would n't know what to do with an airplane

this is the fair and this is where they live
that 's a good idea is n't it
but they could walk across the bridge
now were you go ing to find me a scissors
you read that one to me if you like
well that 's what i need the scissors for
we can make very nice design s with it if we cut some paper to go on it
we have to have scissors to cut it out
how do you know that 's the kind he like s
let 's use this one
we need a circle just that size
a circle just that size
thank you
i 'll trim it just a bit
that 's very nice
yes it 's sort of an egg shape
now adam let 's start i cut this way
you turn this
i 'll hold this down
you turn it
whoops not too fast
you can turn it over and do a different one
lot s of different thing s
not too fast
a head of a turtle
now you can set this in different place s and see what it does
each time you move it it get s a different design
i do n't think it 'll write your name but it 'll make lot s of different design s
alright try
until this write s your name
it might do something surpris ing
let 's make another piece of paper alright
it 's a little bit too big
make it a tiny bit smaller
you like that

let 's make it a tiny bit smaller
that 's right
now it 's just exactly right
it look s like a big flower
another turtle
no more
not too fast
you need to go slower with it
is n't that pretty
that 's enough
okay wait adam
that 's right
i think so
let 's try it
it 's a surprise
not too fast adam because it does n't work
is that a turtle

just a minute
is that your favorite
oh is that alright
what happen ed
oh that 's a good one adam
no just one
shall we trim it just a little bit
shall i draw where you cut it
remember to go very slow when you 're turn ing
so you can get a turtle in the middle
now you can change it
i did n't think you were call ing anyone silly were you
that 's what i thought
try it like that
that make s it wavy
it make s it wavy like on the ocean
it 's hard to hole it is n't it
i could draw around it
would that make it any easier
and you could cut on the line
that 's good
it 's pretty good
which way

alright paul here 's one for you
adam you want to first look here to see all the different kind s of thing you can make
no that 's the top
that 's the part
these are the thing s that you build with see because they rest on one another
no no
adamy do n't do that
they are n't sword s
let 's see you build it
it seem s to me you place these long one s on top of one another
paul we might have to go upstairs hm
what 's this
those are building block s
well this is paul 's
he want s to build
they look like bed s
there are no written direction s
there 's just building there
and you can make your building just like it by just look ing at it
you do n't have what
please let him have some dear
adam let him have some please
look behind you diandra
i think i better take you out
can you build something on there adam
there 's something start ed
can you find another piece like this adam
are there any more big one s
let him have some of the little one s adam
you can have some too
you use these
put some little one s in between and then it stay s better
yes now you can put another long piece on
careful it does n't fall down
now you do the other side
why is it naughty
he can take some
no he 's not
look s like a what
that 's a rooftop
here diandra
let 's give him a few more
let 's see if we ca n't make it stand up
i guess that one 's too small let 's put a bigger one on
did you go to school today
with who
you want to put that one on
what 's the matter
your shoe is untie ed
good and then you can put a roof on
oh yes
what 're you do ing
that look s high enough adam
are they both the same so you can put a roof on
i think this need s to be one higher
no diandra you use those
very carefully
what 're you go ing to do with them
maybe you could make a floor
look at your building and see
oh we should make some step s
that 's a good idea
it would n't be so hard to make step s
oh yes
you could have an open house and walk in
then you do n't need door s and window s but you do need step s
i do n't think so
now where we live
maybe this house is way out in the country
are you go ing to have any furniture in the house
who is go ing to sleep in the bed s
i 'm too big
adam do you know what he 's say ing
not higher than the roof
how could you sleep higher than the roof
i thought we 're pretend ing i 'm small
it 's a bunk bed
is everything alright
i 'm go ing upstairs because paul really is very cranky this afternoon alright
you did n't make a gate
a fence
you need two straight piece s
and a lot of little piece s
i think they have to be the double kind
the fat kind
like that
that 's a good idea
we 'll do that next
right on top
oh that look s good
shall we make a fence all around the house
now you 'll be safe
why do n't move that over because that might not go over the
the fence
thank you
is n't that a pretty fence
we 'll fix that adam that 's not too hard to fix
not too hard
a mouse
a mouse ca n't eat me
i 'll eat the mouse
it is not
did you see any picture s of the circus
have you been to the circus
now we need one more side
oh that 's so pretty adam
now you could fix up the house again and put the roof on
it does n't need a floor
does it need a roof
maybe it does n't
yes that 's right and that could be the water
you can pretend
make another one and we 'll have a race
the boat knock ed down a house
let 's put everything back first
will you help diandra
i did n't bring the top
i have my car just outside
it does n't take very long to get from here to the car
yes it does
it take s very long from harvard
that 's where you use ed to live
i live near there
i 'm in the same place
is that yours
does diandra have one too
apple mommy

then maybe diandra can play with it next
why do n't you let diandra play with the windmill and we 'll put this together
diandra 's your mother
be very careful

try again
we 're go ing to need some cracker s and a bowl
do you want to ask your mother for that
a small bowl
let 's put the cracker s on here and the bowl goes here
put a cracker in here and turn it and see what happen s
what did it make
it 's a grinder
it grind s them up
lot s of what
you can watch it come out here
cracker crumb s
you could put them back through again
a what
a grain thrower
yes or else you could ask your mother if there is anything else she want s ground up
it come s out like a waterfall
i think maybe that 's the last time
watch your finger s
what did you say sugar
yes that 's the one
sure and sheep too
go slow
grain fall
i think maybe that 's enough
they do
they taste salty and delicious
brush yourself off
let 's see if we can rescue some of this alright
that mean s you can grind this up again
that 's a good idea
we 'll just pick it up with the paper
look inside and see how you think it work s
where does it push it
what way
where does the grain go when you push it
and then
you could make some bread with that
you make bread out of grain
oh let 's take a bigger piece
you forgot something
it 'll taste like roast beef
mm chicken
what does yours taste like
let 's make a little funnel
pour it right in
well look what happen s here
what do you think this does when you put a cracker through there
what do you think it does here
how come it get s so small
what do you think it will be like
orange juice

what 's it like
there is n't any
stand up and we 'll clean it all off again
alright but first i have to get it all collect ed
wait for me

why not
we forgot to show your mother the ring s
well i 'll take one and you take two how 's that
what did we forget
shall i get out the pipe cleaner s
it would grind the stick up
yeah but then you could n't eat the grain anymore
that 's right because it 'll be mix ed with stick
i 'll try
no thank you
that 's a good idea
you make a chain
a chain of flower s

old fashion ed glasses
shall we do that after the telescope
why do n't you bake some bread
here 's your telescope

that was very nice of you adam
i would n't be so sure
let me open it
is there a trick to open ing this
try it on paper
does it work
it 's the stamp pad
we may have to put another drop of ink on there
maybe a drop of water would do
just one drop adam
one fill
you do n't need much so you
it wo n't work if you put too much on there
one more drop
what is that
maybe we have to use paint
it 's too wet is n't it
that must be paper to print on
you can see the outline of it
you could print it right in the book
yes it is is n't it
yes you can even take them apart and print them
one what
are those letter s or number s
can you spell your name
diandra he ask ed you not to touch them
stop draw
stop draw
alright draw stop
your name is draw
diandra do n't say stupid
that 's not nice to say
he said what
well what does that mean
i did n't hear you say thank you
a monster magnet
it does does n't it
why do you think it stick s
it 's the most what
oh it 's glue
is that why it 's stick ing
it 's not a magnet after all
it 's not
it 's not come ing out
i do n't think it really need s water
it probably need s a little more ink in the pan
no no this probably need s some more ink
pen ink
stamp ink
that 's not really ink
that 's the water that 's mix ed in with ink
no i do n't think you need water dear
on the pad yes
adam why do n't you let them play with it
come on boy s let 's go upstairs
i do n't want a cat

are you his admirer
why do n't you take that one out
you only had two
here it is on the chair

we could n't find the park ing lot
we come out the wrong door
we come out
the back and the front look exactly alike
you know they 've got the big escalator s to go up and everything
we could n't find the park ing lot
we 're stand ing there kill ing ourselves laugh ing
for an hour we kept walk ing up and down up and down
my poor cousin shirley was so sick
she had an awful cold
we drag ed her all over the place
her feet were kill ing her
finally we come against a guard up front you know
he said
i wonder ed what you three were laugh ing about
we lost the car you know
finally he said
i do n't know where you could 've put it
there 's a little park ing lot way down behind there you go down then you go up and down
he said
the car s always get tow ed away and it 'll cost you eight dollar s
we did n't even have ten cent s to make a phone call
we were hysterical
finally we found the car

three idiot s walk ing up and down the sidewalk

we did n't know whether to go right or to go left
nothing look ed familiar
we did n't know where to go
we went to the lady s room and we had a dime
i had a dime and i gave it to eleanor
she put the dime in the thing that you turn
then instead of push ing it in she push ed it out and the dime went down you know
just then the matron come in

well i put the dime in and the you know i just ca n't get in
the matron said
you you did n't put a dime in
oh it was awful
we had a heck of a time
anyway that girl was upset
she went out and got in the next one and on the way out the woman said
well here 's the dime
by this time eleanor was tear ing you know
and eleanor said
i do n't want the dime
but i put the dime in
she said
well she was right
that 's terrible
they lose more money that way than by give ing out a few dime s to people who put thing s in just as a matter of principle
yeah eleanor say s
i do n't care about the old stink ing dime but it was the only one we had
and she said we did n't put it in you know

see put your finger like this
see how i hold it
you 're do ing this and then you ca n't hardly squeeze it
put it more at the end of your finger s and then you can cut better
