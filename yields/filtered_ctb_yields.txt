it seem s to me you place these long one s on top of one another
those are building block s
well this is paul 's
he want s to build
they look like bed s
there are no written direction s
there 's just building there
and you can make your building just like it by just look ing at it
you do n't have what

i guess that one 's too small let 's put a bigger one on
did you go to school today
with who
you want to put that one on
your shoe is untie ed
good and then you can put a roof on
that look s high enough adam
are they both the same so you can put a roof on
i think this need s to be one higher
no diandra you use those
very carefully
what 're you go ing to do with them
maybe you could make a floor
look at your building and see
oh we should make some step s
that 's a good idea
it would n't be so hard to make step s
you could have an open house and walk in
then you do n't need door s and window s but you do need step s
now where we live
maybe this house is way out in the country
are you go ing to have any furniture in the house
who is go ing to sleep in the bed s
i 'm too big
adam do you know what he 's say ing
not higher than the roof
how could you sleep higher than the roof
i thought we 're pretend ing i 'm small
it 's a bunk bed
is everything alright
you did n't make a gate
a fence
you need two straight piece s
and a lot of little piece s
i think they have to be the double kind
the fat kind
that 's a good idea
we 'll do that next
right on top
oh that look s good
shall we make a fence all around the house
now you 'll be safe
why do n't move that over because that might not go over the
the fence
is n't that a pretty fence
we 'll fix that adam that 's not too hard to fix
not too hard
a mouse
i 'll eat the mouse
it is not
did you see any picture s of the circus
have you been to the circus
now we need one more side
oh that 's so pretty adam
now you could fix up the house again and put the roof on
it does n't need a floor
does it need a roof
maybe it does n't
yes that 's right and that could be the water
you can pretend
make another one and we 'll have a race
the boat knock ed down a house
let 's put everything back first
will you help diandra
i did n't bring the top
i have my car just outside
it does n't take very long to get from here to the car

but this is peace time
peace time mean s there 's no war
make it go high

wait a minute
i have to put this on you
you have to ask me when you want it off

i guess this is go ing to fit here
try again
we 're go ing to need some cracker s and a bowl
do you want to ask your mother for that
a small bowl
let 's put the cracker s on here and the bowl goes here
put a cracker in here and turn it and see what happen s
what did it make
it 's a grinder
it grind s them up
lot s of what
you can watch it come out here
cracker crumb s
you could put them back through again
a grain thrower
it come s out like a waterfall
i think maybe that 's the last time
watch your finger s
what did you say sugar
yes that 's the one
sure and sheep too
go slow
grain fall
i think maybe that 's enough
they do
they taste salty and delicious
brush yourself off
let 's see if we can rescue some of this alright
that mean s you can grind this up again
that 's a good idea
we 'll just pick it up with the paper
look inside and see how you think it work s
where does it push it
what way
where does the grain go when you push it
and then
you could make some bread with that
you make bread out of grain
oh let 's take a bigger piece
you forgot something
it 'll taste like roast beef
mm chicken
what does yours taste like
let 's make a little funnel
pour it right in
well look what happen s here
what do you think this does when you put a cracker through there
what do you think it does here
how come it get s so small
what do you think it will be like
orange juice
now do n't forget to put the bowl back
what 's it like
there is n't any
stand up and we 'll clean it all off again
alright but first i have to get it all collect ed
wait for me
do n't go without me
mine taste s like pepsi_cola
it change s grain into anything you want right
can you make me some strawberry s
why do you have to wait till it get s older
what kind of thing s do you eat that are older
water 's older
only it get s less every time
oh that 's alright
you can
we can use the flower
who 's come ing down
with the what
what did you call it
the grain what
well let 's leave it up alright
i do n't know if i have anything else
maybe you 'll have to show me some thing s alright
you better put those back
the pajama s are n't to play with
i do
we forgot to show your mother the ring s
well i 'll take one and you take two how 's that
what did we forget
shall i get out the pipe cleaner s
it would grind the stick up
yeah but then you could n't eat the grain anymore
that 's right because it 'll be mix ed with stick
you make a chain
a chain of flower s
shall we do that after the telescope
why do n't you bake some bread
here 's your telescope
here diandra
i 'm make ing them

that was very nice of you adam
i would n't be so sure
let me open it
is there a trick to open ing this
try it on paper
does it work
it 's the stamp pad
we may have to put another drop of ink on there
maybe a drop of water would do
just one drop adam
one more drop
maybe we have to use paint
it 's too wet is n't it
that must be paper to print on
you can see the outline of it
you could print it right in the book
yes it is is n't it
yes you can even take them apart and print them
are those letter s or number s
diandra he ask ed you not to touch them
stop draw
stop draw
alright draw stop
your name is draw
diandra do n't say stupid
that 's not nice to say
he said what
well what does that mean
i did n't hear you say thank you
a monster magnet
it does does n't it
why do you think it stick s
it 's the most what
oh it 's glue
is that why it 's stick ing
it 's not a magnet after all
it 's not
it 's not come ing out
i do n't think it really need s water
it probably need s a little more ink in the pan
no no this probably need s some more ink
pen ink
stamp ink
that 's not really ink
that 's the water that 's mix ed in with ink
no i do n't think you need water dear
on the pad yes

you could use this for a target
it 's a dart
aim for the target
you miss ed
i never what
i have an idea what you said

here it is on the chair

are you go ing to be tall enough
promise not to do it again
did it
it 's not up there by glue
she said no just like i said no
it work s like a plunger

see if you can find out why
it 's not glue
it has air
i surely do n't
what do you think happen s when i push down

you did n't hit her
that 's his nursery school teacher
get on the other side honey
you get on this side diandra
close the door diandra

you 're go ing to get too skinny
your little muscle s will go away if you do n't eat though

and you 're use ing your new placemat
yeah i thought he might want to try his new placemat
so you 'd like something over it
so i 'll wash this for another time
i do n't know
i think it 's
these little point s
oh they 're suppose ed to be like grass and plant s and thing s like that in the the landscape all around the dinosaur s
but right here they look sharp do n't they
there you go
the chicken is should be pretty cool
i 'll cut that one and the next one you have i wo n't cut you can just eat it because it will be cool ed off
i knew bro would n't make it home i hope he made it to the library
oh i would n't
his twenty dollar s that he got for his birthday yesterday
is burn ing in his pocket already
it 's been
that 's why he did n't need money to come home from the library yesterday he said i 'll have enough to
i 'm afraid the chicken is not as well cook ed as as usual
i do n't know
well they 'll both be nice and tender on the inside
well i told nathaniel that go ing out to barbecue save s more of a symbolic cash than after it was start ed barbecue ing season
just to celebrate the first day of spring
how 's the chicken munchkin
it take s awhile
because you just ca n't turn the coal s on
like you do an oven
but when you cook it in the oven it does n't taste this good
excuse me i 'm go ing to check the
here a napkin
it all fit on the tape
you got lucky
do you have to use the bathroom honey
they wriggle in their seat s in nathaniel land
does it have rickety chair s
okay thank you
you 're welcome
oh you spill ed a little bit
okay well it 's just a little
you you got the napkin there fast
they 're just about the way they they 're suppose ed to be
under done
not under done but done just right
well it 's just that light golden brown across the top
that 's not light golden brown
it 's medium golden brown
but it 's not burnt
the other way the mushy part is suppose ed to be flaky
yeah that 's true
i like ed it
true when mushy then i ca n't separate these little layer s
those calendar s
these barbecue ed calendar s
you want to eat the calendar
when did you eat a calendar
nathaniel are you sure you do n't have to go to the bathroom
if you have to go to the bathroom come back and have food to eat after that
that 's how they sit nathaniel down
just to avoid confrontation
and it would be very unhealthy to have that like that all the time
what the hell it 's the first day of spring
usually the first barbecue of the year the chicken is n't cook ed right it take s a couple time s in the warm weather
in the warm weather you can still cook it and just stay out there with the barbecue
in the cold weather you say let 's cook this sucker fast
because when i look ed out the window up front the sky was all gray
we just watch ed the sun set
there 's no school today
there 's no one there to answer the phone
it 's sunday
they 're all home eat ing
even the teacher s
they 're not go ing to go to school when they do n't have to
they have family s too you know that
you know gail has a son and karen has a son
blow your nose please
that 's what i heard it alright
well i think karen is probably home with christopher right now
are n't you sad when your mummy goes to work
are n't you sad when your mummy goes to work
i 'll wait until after dinner then
no toy s at our table
no toy s at our table
dylan 's in his last minute thing again

that 's very sharp
oh yuck

nathaniel no
do n't swing your head around while you 're eat ing
are you drink ing your quick
i mean between bite s
well we did n't see them at christmas time
we well
we gave her her birthday present honey in august when she had her birthday
and we gave her her christmas present before christmas and what they gave you was your christmas present yesterday
but michael 's birthday was in january
and we never saw him in january so that 's why he got his present yesterday
melanie remember s that we gave her present before
because your birthday is come ing up next month
last year they did
you know your your video tape s with cartoon s on them
which cartoon s were they
i do n't know bugs bunny and thing s like that
yes yes
that 's right they gave you that the tape
the pin cushion man who pop s the balloon s
no it 's not
you mean tell him not to pop the balloon s
you can tell him too you know
except it 's a cartoon than
pop ing balloon s
do n't the balloon s win in the end
do n't they find their way to get rid of the pin cushion man
do they
maybe we 'll have to watch the cartoon again soon to see how
no he ca n't pop their balloon s any more like that
good memory nathaniel i did n't remember that part
do you want another piece of
want another piece of chicken
it has a lot of bone
let us see if i
i know
here here you go
i like to wrap the biscuit s and have chicken and biscuit s
not me
i want to eat dinner
i think we should eat instead of play ing television do n't you think
can you turn your television off for a couple of minute s
oh good
can you put it away
i think it 's the fan that you must hear
no the refrigerator just kick ed on
never mind
well tough
oh do n't say that because if the refrigerator stop s everything that 's in the freezer will thaw and it will not be any good and everything that 's in the refrigerator will get warm and it will n't be cold anymore
we have to keep everything cold in the refrigerator
that 's why we have a refrigerator
and it make s that noise because it 's work ing right
and it 's a quiet noise
dylan is probably at the library until they 're clos ed
you think so
when he left here it was after two
and he 's go ing to earling 's house today
and you know he probably did n't get to the library before three thirty
the library close s at
five thirty
five five thirty
five or five thirty
i 'm sorry i did n't get it
he was say ing if the library was n't open that 's alright
other kid s will be done with the book s they took out of the library and and i can look at them and mine
so social study s is n't the first thing they had in mind
nathaniel you 're crazy

you skip ed a whole bunch of it more did n't you
that was a nice one of honey
did you hear that one daddy
i heard it all the way from the other room
i thought you would
i one that i 'd like to hear is love is something if you give it away
i would like to hear love is something if you give it away
i like that one
only you know this song here
then you ca n't sing that one right
when you do learn it better will you sing it to us
that 's the first time i ever heard that second part of love is something that about the penny part
i never heard that part before
love is like a magic penny
i 'm go ing to turn the overhead light off
just just one of them
you still have the two other light s on in the room
i 'll turn the fan back on
but we do n't need the fan
it 's just nice to to have the fan on low
i was go ing to have a a cigarette if that would n't be objectionable
oh that 's why you want ed the fan on
i mean if i have to sit and smoke in the kitchen might as well turn the overhead fan on

where is this conversation come ing from
boy he has got a one track mind tonight huh
i have n't seen a seahorse sabato since i was a little girl
little tiny seahorse s
they were about the size of a half a dollar
when daddy was a little boy we use ed to go buy them
little goldfish little seahorse s little turtle s
and do n't ask me how long
that 's right
do you know what a seahorse eat s
what does a seahorse eat
a seahorse eat s plankton and microbacteria that float around in the ocean
now you need a special lens or a special pair of glasses to see this microbacteria but it 's food for the seahorse s
and plankton and and microbacteria are just about the same
and that 's where they get all of their nourishment from
now a shark is a bigger animal a bigger fish i should say and that eat s a shark will eat other fish
listen listen to daddy
not all fish eat other fish
there are some fish that do n't eat other fish
do you understand me
some fish just eat plankton and like that microbacteria that i 'm tell ing you about
that 's right
and they that 's right
well they 're all fish
a fish has to stay in the water
now you know what a dolphin is do n't you
a dolphin does n't have to stay in the water all of the time
a dolphin can come up a dolphin is a mammal
and a mammal they live in the ocean but they can breath our air
a whale big big whale
see the big whale s
like in pinnochio the big whale
that 's a mammal
it 's not a fish
it live s in the ocean like a fish but
it 's a mammal and
it can breath our air
a fish ca n't breath our air
they have to breath the air that they make in the water
you understand now
i 'm try ing to put a tape on
the aquarium we 're go ing to go to the aquarium
dolphin show
how 's that
a boy is never alive if he 's made out of wood
you understand me
pinnochio is just a movie
movie s are make believe
they do make movie s that are base ed on you know true life event s but for the most part the thing s that you see on television are fictional
in other word s it 's make believe

govenor dukakis is slash ing the state budget
i saw it on the news report
and worcester 's share of that is about eleven million dollar s
but everybody would feel the cut s
it 's not clear whether everybody would feel the cut s equally
so the particular place that i 'm fund ed under is fund ed directly by the state but it goes through the city
because they 're go ing to try to do this in the next few week s
that 's for me right
he ask ed if anybody had any question s and everybody just sat there
honey use your fork next time
hopefully i 'd find another one hopefully i 'll find another one before they cut it
okay you can have both
yeah probably something like two month s
see you later
what happen ed was the city does n't have as much money
oh i am
the city does n't have as much money and so they have to look to see how they can save money
one of the way s they may try to save money is by take ing people 's job s away
which mean s that that person would n't have a job
i do n't know yet that i do but i may have to so i 've been start ing to look in the paper for other job s
that would be nice

well sometimes baby s do n't know how to walk very well

that 's a little tiny tunnel
no i do n't think he can fit do you
that 's the axle of the wheel s
